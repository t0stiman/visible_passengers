# Visible passengers 

![screenshot](screenshot.png)

This Railroader mod adds visible passengers to the passenger cars in the game.   
The amount of visible passengers matches the amount of passengers that have boarded the train. However, the passenger coaches in the game sadly only have a few functional seats so the coaches will not fill up completely.

## How to install

1. install Unity Mod Manager(UMM) and configure it for Railroader
2. download this mods zip and yeet it into UMM
